 #hey! I am Aaush , and this is my Machine Learning Repository!
 
 															ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE 
					AI is a Science and Engneering of making Intelligent Machines!
															
															
															
	$- AI covers Domains Such as :-
		1. knowledge Base
		2. *Machine learning*
		3. Natural Lamnguage Processing
		4. Deep Learning
		5. Expert Systems
		6. Computer Visions,etc
		
		
																MACHINE LEARNING
																
	$- It is a Part of AI, It provides machines the ability to learn automaticallyu and improve from Experience with the help of Data!
	
	
						$- Machine Learning Terms:-
	
	1. ALGORITHM - A set of rules and Statistical Techniques used to learn patterns from Data!
	
	2. MODEL - main Component , which is trained by using a Machine Learning algorithm.
	
	3. Predictor Variable - Feature of the Data , that can be used to predict the Output!
	
	4. Response Variable - Output which is to be Predicted.
	
	5. Training Data - The Machine Learning model is built using the Training Data.
	
	6. Testing Data - The Machine Learning model is evaluated using the Testing Data.
	
	
						$- STEPS OF MACHINE LEANRNING
						
	1. Define the Objectve of your Problem - What you want to Predict by Machine Learning.
	
	2. Data Gathering - Collecting Data.
	
	3. Preparing Data(Data Cleaning)- Removing Unnecessary Data!
	
	4. Data Exploration - Finding Patterns, Trends, and Relations in Data!
	
	5. Building a Model - [ DATA = i. Training Data, ii. Testing Data] We will build a Model of our Machine Learning Data!
	
	6. Model Evaluation - Testing Model's Accuracy, efficiency and Improving it with the help of different applications!
	
	7. Predictions -  The Final Stage, Here we get the final Output which is Preiction!
	
	
						$- TYPES OF MACHINE LEANRNING
						
	1. Supervised Learning - Technique in which we teach or train the machine by using well labeled Data(training Data)
	
	2. Unsupervised Learning - Training the Machine with Unlabelled Data, Without any Guide!
	
	3. reinforcement Learning - Advanced Machine Learning, it Develops it's own data by exploring it! No Pre-defined data!
	
	
						$- TYPES OF PROBLEMS SOLVED IN MACHINE LEANRNING
	
	
	1. REGRESSION - (supervised Learning) Output is Continuous Quantity.
					Main aim is to Forecast or Predict!
					Example: Predictiopn of Stock Market prices! 
					Algorithm: Linear Regression.
	
	2. CLASSIFICATION - (supervised Learning) Output is Categorical Quantity(yes or no type!).
					Main aim is to compute(seperate) the category of the data!
					Example: Classify emails as Spam or Non- Spam Emails.
					Algorithm: Logistic Regression.					
	
	3. CLUSTERING - (Unsupervised Learning) Assigns Data points into clusters(grouping).
					Main aim is to Group Similar items clusters.
					Example: Netflix Seperates different people (data) in different clusters according to their Taste! 
					Algorithm: K-means.
